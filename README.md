# 0. Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------

The idea of this repo is to provide an optimised, complete, pre-trained `🐣 Demo-in-a-Box` environments for IBM IT Automation Solutions that are self-contained (e.g. can be deployed in only one cluster)

<details>
<summary>Details...</summary>

> It contains the following components (which can be installed independently):
> 
>  - **IBM AIOps**
>  - **IBM AIOps Demo Content**  (optional)
>     - **OpenLDAP** & Register with IBM AIOps
>     - **Runbooks** AWX (Open Source Ansible Tower) with preloaded Playbooks and AIOps Runbooks
>     - **AI Models** - Load and Train 
> 	    - Load Training Data (LAGS, SNOW, MET, TG) 
>       - Create Training Definitions (TG, LAGS, CR, SI, MET. Turn off RSA) 
>       - Train Models (TG, LAGS, CR, SI, MET) 
>     - **Topology**
>       - Live Demo Apps (RobotShop. SockShop)
>       - Create IBM AIOps Topology and Applications (RobotShop. SockShop, ACME, London Underground, Telecom FiberCut)
>		- Dedicated DemoUI that allows you to trigger different scenarios
>		- Custom Icons (styling and dynamic)
>     - **Configs**
>		- Policies for Incident creation
>		- Custom Alert View
>
>  - **IBM Concert** 
>  - **IBM Concert Demo Content** 
> 
>  - **IBM Turbonomic** 
>  - **IBM Turbonomic Demo Content** 
> 
>  - **IBM Instana** 
>  - **IBM Instana Demo Content** 

> #### ⚠️ **This method creates an in-cluster installation**
> 
> - It's way faster
> - You don't have to install all the tooling locally
> - You don’t need a connection to the cluster during the installation (fire and forget)
> 
> 🤓 So this could basically be done from an iPhone or iPad

## 🚀 Getting Started

Basically:

* Get an OpenShift Cluster
* Get your entitlement key/pull token
* Paste the install file into the OpenShift web UI and insert your entitlement key
* Grab a coffe and come back after 2-3 hours depending on the modules you're installing

# 1. Preparation
---------------------------------------------------------------




<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<details>
<summary>✅ Prerequisites</summary>

## 1.1 Prerequisites 



### 1.1.1 Get an OpenShift Cluster (IBMers and IBM Partners only)



1. Get a temporary cluster from **Techzone**
	- OpenShift Cluster (OCP-V) - IBM Cloud (https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations/create/66576e78d3aaab001ef9aa8d)
	- OpenShift VMWare Cluster - UPI - Deployer - V2 (https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/tech-zone-certified-base-images/journey-pre-installed-software)

	- 4x worker nodes with **32 CPU / 128 GB**  ❗

	- 3x worker nodes with **16 CPU / 64 GB**  for IBM Concert❗


	You **might** get away with less if you don't install some components but no guarantee.

1. Create a cluster for `Practice/Self Education` or `Test` if you don't have an Opportunity Number (Screenshots are slightly outdated and are different for the different TechZone offerings but the basic choices remain the same)

	![K8s CNI](./doc/pics/roks05.png)

1. Select your preferred Geograpy


1. Select the maximum end date that fits your needs (you can extend the duration once after creation)

	![K8s CNI](./doc/pics/roks03.png) 

1. Select Openshift Version

   - Select: **4.18** 

  	![K8s CNI](./doc/pics/roks07.png)

1. Select the Cluster Size

	- Worker node count: **4**
	- Flavour: **32 vCPU X 128 GB** ❗ 

	> ❗ If you want to install IBM AIOps and Trubonomic you must select **5 x 32 vCPU X 128 GB** 



1. Click `Submit`
1. Once the cluster is provisioned, don't forget to extend it as needed.


### 1.1.2 Get the entitlement key (registry pull token) 

You can get the entitlement key (registry pull token) from [https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary).

This allows the images to be pulled from the IBM Container Registry.

<summary>⚠️ Important remarks before you start</summary>

## ⚠️⚠️ 1.2 Important remarks before you start ⚠️⚠️

Those are remarks to feedback and problem reports I got from the field.

Those scripts have been tested thoroughly on different environments and have proven to be VERY reliable.

If you think that you hit a problem:

* If you have provisioned a cluster with `Managed NFS 2TB` and you have Pods in `0/0` state verify the `nfs-provisioner` Pod is running. If not (this is a bug in Techzone) please apply `./tools/00_troubleshooting/nfs-provisioner.yaml`. The installation should subsequently continue. If not, please [re-run the installer Pod](#re-run-the-installer).
* Make sure that you have provisioned a cluster with **4 worker nodes with 32 CPU and 128 GB** each. If you have Pods in `0/0` state verify the `Events`. If you get `Not enough CPU` then delete the cluster and provision the correct size.
* If you want to install IBM AIOps and Turbonomic you **must** select **5 worker nodes with 32 CPU and 128 GB**
* The complete installation takes about 1.5 to 8 hours depending on your region where and the platform you deployed to.
* If you see Pods in `CrashLoop` or other error states, try to wait it out (this can be due to dependencies on other componenets that are not ready yet). Chances are that the deployment will eventually go through. If after 8h you are still stuck, ping me.
### ❗ So simply put be patient and make sure you have the correct size of cluster provisioned!

### ❗ If you encounter problems or missing stuff in your demo environment (no training, no topology, no runbooks, ...) you can re-run the installer by deleting the installer Pod. **The install scripts are NON DESTRUCTIVE** and can be run as many times as you like without corrupting/destroying anything.

## 3.2 Demo Setup - Explained
---------------------------------------------------------------


![demo](./doc/pics/aiops_arch_overview.jpg)

<details>
<summary>📥 3.2.1 Basic Architecture</summary>

### Basic Architecture

The environement (Kubernetes, Applications, ...) create logs that are being fed into a Log Management Tool (ELK in this case).

![demo](./doc/pics/aiops_arch_overview.jpg)

1. External Systems generate Alerts and send them into the IBM AIOps for Event Grouping.
1. At the same time IBM AIOps ingests the raw logs coming from the Log Management Tool (ELK) and looks for anomalies in the stream based on the trained model.
2. It also ingests Metric Data and looks for anomalies
1. If it finds an anomaly (logs and/or metrics) it forwards it to the Event Grouping as well.
1. Out of this, IBM AIOps creates an Incident that is being enriched with Topology (Localization and Blast Radius) and with Similar Incidents that might help correct the problem.
1. The Incident is then sent to Slack.
1. A Runbook is available to correct the problem but not launched automatically.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<details>
<summary>📥 3.2.2 Optimized Demo Architecture</summary>

### Optimized Demo Architecture

The idea of this repo is to provide a optimised, complete, pre-trained demo environment that is self-contained (e.g. can be deployed in only one cluster)

It contains the following components (which can be installed independently):

 - **IBM AIOps**
 	- IBM Operator
 	- IBM AIOps Instance
 - **IBM AIOps Demo Content**  (optional)
    - **OpenLDAP** & Register with IBM AIOps
    - **AWX** (Open Source Ansible Tower) with preloaded Playbooks
    - **AI Models** - Load and Train 
      - Create Training Definitions (TG, LAD, CR, SI. Turn off RSA) 
      - Create Training Data (LAD, SNOW) 
      - Train Models (TG, LAD, CR, SI) 
    - **Topology**
      - RobotShop Demo App
      - Create K8s Observer
      - Create ASM merge rules
      - Load Overlay Topology
      - Create IBM AIOps Application
    - **Misc**
     	- Creates valid certificate for Ingress (Slack) 
		- External Routes (Flink, Topology, ...)
		- Disables ASM Service match rule 
		- Create Policy Creation for Stories and Runbooks 
		- Demo Service Account 
 - **Turbonomic**  (optional)
 - **Turbonomic Demo Content** (optional)
	- Demo User
	- RobotShop Demo App with synthetic metric
	- Instana target (if Instana is installed - you have to enter the API Token Manually)
	- Groups for vCenter and RobotShop
	- Groups for licensing
	- Resource Hogs

![demo](./doc/pics/aiops_arch_dataflow.jpg)


For the this specific Demo environment:

* ELK is not needed as I am using pre-canned logs for training and for the anomaly detection (inception)
* Same goes for Metrics, I am using pre-canned metric data for training and for the anomaly detection (inception)
* The Events are also created from pre-canned content that is injected into IBM AIOps
* There are also pre-canned ServiceNow Incidents if you don’t want to do the live integration with SNOW
* The Webpages that are reachable from the Events are static and hosted on my GitHub
* The same goes for ServiceNow Incident pages if you don’t integrate with live SNOW

This allows us to:

* Install the whole Demo Environment in a self-contained OCP Cluster
* Trigger the Anomalies reliably
* Get Events from sources that would normally not be available (Instana, Turbonomic, Log Aggregator, Metric Provider, ...)
* Show some examples of SNOW integration without a live system

<summary>📥 3.2.3 Training </summary>

### Training

#### 3.2.3.1 Loading training data

![demo](./doc/pics/aiops_arch_training.jpg)

Loading Training data is done at the lowest possible level (for efficiency and speed):

* Logs: Loading Elastic Search indexes directly into ES - two days of logs for March 3rd and 4th 2022
* SNOW: Loading Elastic Search indexes directly into ES - synthetic data with 15k change requests and 5k incidents
* Metrics: Loading Cassandra dumps of metric data - 3 months of synthetic data for 13 KPIs


#### 3.2.3.2 Training the models

The models can be trained directly on the data that has been loaded as described above.


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

</details>
<details>
<summary>📥 3.2.4 Incident creation</summary>

### Incident creation (inception)

![demo](./doc/pics/aiops_arch_inception.jpg)

Incidents are being created by using the high level APIs in order to simulate a real-world scenario.

* Events: Pre-canned events are being injected through the corresponding REST API
* Logs: Pre-canned anomalous logs for a 30 min timerange are injected through Kafka
* Metrics: Anomalous metric data are generated on the fly and injected via the corresponding REST API
</details>


> ℹ️ You can find a more detailed presentation about how the automation works here: [PDF](https://ibm.box.com/s/gx0tcubl9k4phvdsrffd7taragrmvz02).

---------------------------------------------------------------
## 3.3 Custom Scenarios
---------------------------------------------------------------

![demo](./doc/pics/custom01.png)

This feature allows you to easily create custom scenarios for the IBM AIOps Demo UI.

By default the custom scenario is disabled. In order to enable it you have to modify the `ibm-aiops-demo-ui-config-custom` ConfigMap in the `ibm-aiops-demo-ui` Namespace.

> ℹ️ The Topology will be loaded only the first time. Once the Application exists it will not update.
>
> ℹ️ If you want to update the Topology after a modification of the CustomMap, you can use the `Reload Topolgy` Button on the `About` Tab.


### 3.3.1 📥 Custom Scenario Parameters

<details>
<summary>📥 Topology</summary>

#### 3.3.1.1 Topology

To create a complete Topology/Application, you have to define the following variables:

- `CUSTOM_TOPOLOGY_APP_NAME` : Name for the Application (if this is left empty, no Application is created)
- `CUSTOM_TOPOLOGY_TAG` : Tag used to create the Topology Template (if this is left empty, no Template is created)
- `CUSTOM_TOPOLOGY`: Topology definition, will be loaded through a File Explorer (make sure that you have a corresponding tag to create the Template)

❗ IMPORTANT: The complete topology is loaded each time the DemoUI Pod is restarting

> ### ❗ Globally: if there is and error or something missing [re-run the installer Pod](#re-run-the-installer)
> ### ❗ 99% of the time this corrects the problem


<details>
<summary>📥 CP4AIOPS Base installation Failing at 10-20 pods</summary>


If you have provisioned a cluster with `Managed NFS 2TB` and you have Pods in `0/0` state in the `ibm-aiops` Namespace, verify the `nfs-provisioner` Pod is running. If not (this is a bug in Techzone) please apply `./tools/00_troubleshooting/nfs-provisioner.yaml`. The installation should subsequently continue. 
If not, please [re-run the installer Pod](#re-run-the-installer).

</details>


<details>
<summary>📥 CP4AIOPS Base installation Failing at 60-90 pods</summary>


If your CP4AIPS installtion gets stuck at 60-90 Pods in the `ibm-aiops` Namespace, there is not much I can do to help - this is not a problem with the scripts!

✅ Please [try this YAML](https://github.com/niklaushirt/ibm-aiops-deployer/blob/main/tools/00_troubleshooting/CP4AIOPS_INSTALL_HACK.yaml)

</details>








<details>
<summary>📥 I'm getting a certificate error when opening CP4AIOPS or Turbonomic</summary>

❗If you are using IBM TechZone Clusters you will get certificate errors when trying to open CP4AIOPS or Turbonomic

✅ Open the links in a Private/Incognito window and select proceed

✅ Or in Chrome you can type `thisisunsafe`  when on the `Your connection is not private` page. There is no visual feedback but if you type it correctly the page will then load.

<details>
<summary>📥 Missing stuff in CP4AIOps</summary>

If you have missing elements:
- Incomplete Topology
- Missing Policies
- Missing Runbooks

✅ Please [re-run the installer Pod](#re-run-the-installer).

</details>

<details>
<summary>📥 Training not done or incomplete</summary>


If you have missing or incomplete Training

✅ Please [re-run the installer Pod](#re-run-the-installer).

For deeper understanding of the problem you can check the logs of the Data Load Pods 

![demo](./doc/pics/pods_training.png)

</details>



## Re-Run the installer


> #### ❗ You can re-run the installer as many times as you want.
> #### ❗ It won't destroy anything!

1. Go to your OpenShift UI
2. Select Namespace `ibm-installer`
3. Select Workloads/Pods
4. You should see something like this

	![demo](./doc/pics/restartinstall01.png)

5. click on the three dots at the end of the line for Pod `ibm-aiops-install-aiops-xxx`
6. Select Delete

	![demo](./doc/pics/restartinstall02.png)

7. Confirm

This will restart the complete installation process. But it will be much faster as it is mainly incremental.
