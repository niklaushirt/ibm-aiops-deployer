# 🚀 3 Detailed Ansible Install
---------------------------------------------------------------

## ❗ This method will be deprecated and should not be used anymore. 
### ❗I WILL NOT TEST THIS FOR NEW RELEASES GOING FORWARD
Please use the in-cluster installation method in chapter 1:
- It's way faster
- You don't have to install all the tooling locally
- You don’t need a connection to the cluster during the installation (fire and forget)


## 3.1 Get the code 


Clone the GitHub Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/niklaushirt/ ibm-aiops-deployer.git -b ibm-aiops_stable
```


## 3.2 Prerequisites 


### 3.2.1 OpenShift requirements 

I installed the demo in a ROKS environment.

You'll need:

- ROKS 4.12
- 5x worker nodes Flavour `b3c.16x64` (so 16 CPU / 64 GB) 




You **might** get away with less if you don't install some components (Event Manager, ELK, Turbonomic,...) but no guarantee:

- Typically 4x worker nodes Flavour `b3c.16x64` _**for only IBMAIOps**_

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.2.2 Get a ROKS Cluster (IBMers and IBM Partners only)

IBMers can get a temporary one from [Techzone](https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/custom-roks-vmware-requests) (ususally valid for 2 weeks)

1. Create a cluster for `Practice/Self Education` if you don't have an Opportunity Number

	![K8s CNI](./doc/pics/roks01.png)

1. Select the maximum end date that fits your needs (you can extend the duration once after creation)

	![K8s CNI](./doc/pics/roks03.png)
	
1. Fill-in the remaining fields

	1. Geograpy: whatever is closest to you
	2. Worker node count: 5
	3. Flavour: b3c.16x64
	4. OpenShift Version: 4.12

	![K8s CNI](./doc/pics/roks02.png)

1. Click `Submit`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.2.3 Tooling 

❗ Only needed if you decide to install from your PC

You need the following tools installed in order to follow through this guide:

- ansible
- oc (4.8 or greater)
- jq
- kafkacat (only for training and debugging)
- elasticdump (only for training and debugging)
- IBM cloudctl (only for LDAP)



#### 3.2.3.1 On Mac - Automated (preferred) 

*Only needed if you decide to install from your PC*

Just run:

```bash
./tools/10_prerequisites/install_prerequisites_mac.sh
```

#### 3.2.3.2 On Ubuntu - Automated (preferred) 

*Only needed if you decide to install from your PC*

Just run:

```bash
./tools/10_prerequisites/install_prerequisites_ubuntu.sh
```

 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.2.4 Get the IBMAIOPS installation token (registry pull token) 

You can get the installation (registry pull token) token from [https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary).

This allows the IBMAIOPS images to be pulled from the IBM Container Registry.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 3.3 IBMAIOps Installation


You have different options:
	
1. **Install from your PC** *with the token from 1.3.1*
	```bash
	ansible-playbook ./ansible/01_ ibm-aiops-aimanager-all.yaml -e cp_entitlement_key=<REGISTRY_TOKEN> 
	```
	
1. **Install with the Easy Installer** *with the token from 1.3.1*
	1. Just run:
		```bash
		./01_easy-install.sh -t <REGISTRY_TOKEN>
		```

	2. Select option 🐥`10` to install the complete `IBMAIOps` environment with Demo Content.




> This takes about 1.5 to 2 hours.
> After completion Easy Installer will open the documentation and the IBMAIOps webpage (on Mac) and you'll have to to perform the last manual steps.

> You now have a full, basic installtion of IBMAIOps with:
> 
>  - IBMAIOps
>  - Open LDAP & Register with IBMAIOps
>  - RobotShop demo application
>  - Trained Models based on pre-canned data (Log- and Metric Anomalies, Similar Incidents, Change Risk)
>  - Topologies for demo scenarios
>  - AWX (OpenSource Ansible Tower) with runbooks for the demo scenarios
>  - Demo UI
>  - Demo Service Account 
>  - Valid certificate for Ingress (Slack) 
>  - External Routes (Flink, Topology, ...)
>  - Policies for Stories and Runbooks 
>

**Configure Slack**
 
Continue [here](#4-slack-integration) for [Slack integration](#4-slack-integration)



### 3.3.2 First Login

After successful installation, the Playbook creates a file `./LOGINS.txt` in your installation directory (only if you installed from your PC).

> ℹ️ You can also run `./tools/20_get_logins.sh` at any moment. This will print out all the relevant passwords and credentials.

#### 3.3.2.1 Get the URL

* Run `./tools/20_get_logins.sh` to get all the logins and URLs

or

* Run:

```bash
export AIOPS_NAMESPACE=$(oc get po -A|grep aiops-orchestrator-controller |awk '{print$1}')
	
echo "🌏 IBMAIOps:           https://$(oc get route -n $AIOPS_NAMESPACE cpd -o jsonpath={.spec.host})"
echo "🌏 Demo UI:              https://$(oc get route -n $AIOPS_NAMESPACE aiops-demo-ui-python -o jsonpath={.spec.host})"

```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.5.4 Event Manager Configuration 

#### 3.5.4.1 EventManager Webhook 

Create Webhooks in EventManager for Event injection and incident simulation for the Demo.

The demo scripts (in the `demo` folder) give you the possibility to simulate an outage without relying on the integrations with other systems.

At this time it simulates:

- Git push event
- Log Events (ELK)
- Security Events (Falco)
- Instana Events
- Metric Manager Events (Predictive)
- Turbonomic Events
- CP4MCM Synthetic Selenium Test Events



You have to define the following Webhook in EventManager (NOI): 

* `Administration` / `Integration with other Systems`
* `Incoming` / `New Integration`
* `Webhook`
* Name it `Demo Generic`
* Jot down the WebHook URL and copy it to the `NETCOOL_WEBHOOK_GENERIC` in the `./tools/01_demo/incident_robotshop-noi.sh`file
* Click on `Optional event attributes`
* Scroll down and click on the + sign for `URL`
* Click `Confirm Selections`


Use this json:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "1619706828000",
  "severity": "Critical",
  "summary": "Test Event",
  "nodename": "productpage-v1",
  "alertgroup": "robotshop",
  "url": "https://pirsoscom.github.io/grafana-robotshop.html"
}
```
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Fill out the following fields and save:

* Severity: `severity`
* Summary: `summary`
* Resource name: `nodename`
* Event type: `alertgroup`
* Url: `url`
* Description: `"URL"`

Optionnally you can also add `Expiry Time` from `Optional event attributes` and set it to a convenient number of seconds (just make sure that you have time to run the demo before they expire.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


#### 3.5.4.2 Create custom Filters and Views


##### 3.5.4.2.1 Filter 


* In the `Event Manager` "Hamburger" Menu select `Netcool WebGui`
* Click `Administration`
* Click `Filters`
* Select `Global Filters` from the DropDown menu
* Select `Default`
* Click `Copy Filter` (the two papers on the top left) 
* Set to `global`
* Click `Ok`
* Name: AIOPS
* Logic: **Any** ❗ (the right hand option)
* Filter:
	* AlertGroup = 'CEACorrelationKeyParent'
	* AlertGroup = 'robot-shop'

![](./doc/pics/noi10.png)


##### 3.5.4.2.2 View 
* In the `Event Manager` "Hamburger" Menu select `Netcool WebGui`
* Click `Administration`

* Toggle `Enabled` to `On`
* Save

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 3.5.4.4 Create Menu item

In the Netcool WebGUI

* Go to `Administration` / `Tool Configuration`
* Click on `LaunchRunbook`
* Copy it (the middle button with the two sheets)
* Name it `Launch URL`
* Replace the Script Command with the following code

	```javascript
	var urlId = '{$selected_rows.URL}';
	
	if (urlId == '') {
	    alert('This event is not linked to an URL');
	} else {
	    var wnd = window.open(urlId, '_blank');
	}
	```
* Save

Then 

* Go to `Administration` / `Menu Configuration`
* Select `alerts`
