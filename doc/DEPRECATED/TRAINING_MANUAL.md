# 22 Manually train the models
---------------------------------------------------------------



## 22.1 Train Logs 

### 22.1.1 Load Training Data into ElasticSearch


Run the following scripts to inject training data:
	
```bash
oc apply -n default -f ./tools/02_training/load-job-logs.yaml
```

This takes creates a Job in your cluster that will pull and load the training data. This can take some time (20-60 minutes depending on your Internet speed).

* Click `Next`
* Click `Create`


#### 22.1.2.2 Train the Log Anomaly model

* Click on the `Manager` Tab
* Click on the `LogAnomaly` entry
* Click `Start Training`
* This will start a precheck that should tell you after a while that you are ready for training ant then start the training

After successful training you should get:
